# Urban-Climate-Analytics-NYC
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts Urban Heat Island (UHI) intensity using satellite imagery and environmental indices. The analysis combines Sentinel-2 multi-spectral GeoTIFF data with ground-truth UHI measurements to generate high-resolution spatial heat maps for New York City.
